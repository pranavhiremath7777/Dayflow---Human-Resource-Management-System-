## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌐 Offline-First & Local Database Engine
- **Zero Cloud Reliance**: Built with a dedicated **Local Storage Database Engine** (`src/lib/dayflow-local-db.ts`) that persists employee profiles, attendance logs, leave applications, and payroll structures locally in browser storage.
- **Offline Operations**: Check-ins, leave requests, profile updates, and salary edits function seamlessly even when disconnected from internet or cloud infrastructure.

### 🔐 Authentication & Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Support for Administrators, HR Managers, and Standard Employees.
- **Secure Authentication**: Integrated with Supabase Auth (Email/Password, Session management) and instant local token validation.
- **Protected Routes**: Enforced server-side and client-side authentication guards using TanStack Start routes.

### ⏱️ Attendance & Time Tracking

- **Detailed Profiles**: Manage personal details, contact info, job role, joining date, emergency contacts, and salary info.
- **Profile Editor**: Modal dialog for editing employee information with automatic 256px WebP avatar image cropping.

### 🏖️ Leave Management System

- **Approval Workflow**: Dedicated HR/Admin approval and rejection interface with reviewer feedback.

### 💰 Payroll & Payslips
